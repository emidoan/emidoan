i'm emily, and i go by she/her pronouns. i grew up in the inland empire, but now i am going to school at the university of california, irvine!

i am passionate about developing tech for social good, whether it be through recognizing and solving disparities in tech, or increasing accessibility in digital design. on a technical standpoint, i am primarily interested in front-end development and ui/ux design, but i am still learning new things! i hope to get my masters in ai/ml or bioinformatics one day... ðŸ’­

on my free time, i love creating art, watching anime, and social justice organizing. ðŸŒ±
